// 1 Generate two large random primes, p and q, of approximate equal size such that their product n = pq 

// 2. compute n = pq and ϕ = (p-1)(q-1)

// 3. Choose an integer e, 1 < e < ϕ such that gdc(e,q) = 1 

// 4. compute secret exponent d, 1 < d < ϕ such that ed = 1 mod ϕ

// 5. The public key is (n,e) and the private key (d,p,q). Keep all the values d, p, q and ϕ secret. 
//    [Sometimes the private key is written as (n,d) because you need the value of n when using d. 
//     Other times we might write the key pair as ((N,e),d).]
